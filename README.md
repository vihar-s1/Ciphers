## NOTE

 ___Make sure to run the `setupScript.sh` script to setup the virtual environment, install the required pip modules and install the project in the environment to make certain modules accessible everywhere___

```bash
bash setupScript.sh
```

> No additional modules except for `os`, `re`, and `numpy` are required for running any of the code so far.

## Contributing

- If you want to contribute, follow the contribution guidelines here: [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vihar-s1/Ciphers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- If you encounter an issue or want to report a bug, following is the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/vihar-s1/Ciphers/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) you will be asked to follow.
- Any new feature requests will be appreciated if it follows the predefined [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/vihar-s1/Ciphers/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

## Cipher Guidelines

- `Classical` folder contains the implementation of classical ciphers.
- `PrivateKey` folder contains the implementation of private key ciphers.
- Both the folders have their own `README.md` files which contain the guidelines for the respective ciphers.
