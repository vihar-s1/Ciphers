# Ciphers

Consists of implementations of various classical and private key cryptographic algorithms.

## Classical Cryptography Ciphers

### Shift Cipher
The most basic form of cipher. It involves shifting operation of the plain text to generate cipher text. Based on the key selected from 0 to 25, the alphabet is shifted by that much to obtain the encryted text.

> plain text: "Hello World"<br>
key = 5 <br>
Cipher generated: "mjqqt btwqi"
